# TravellingSalesMan-Project

> This project is visual C# based with an added connection of MS SQL with a local server
> This code was written as part of a semester group project for the course of data structures and algorithms
> Project has some additional functionalities apart from just implementing TSA
> Project may also contain some redundant and unnecessary code because this was just made by a bunch of students :)
